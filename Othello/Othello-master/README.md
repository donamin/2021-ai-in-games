Othello
======================

What is Othello?
-------------------------------

Othello is a board game in which you must outwit the computer by capturing more pieces than it. Each turn you place a piece down that traps at least one computer piece between two of your own, converting all such pieces to your own side. The game continues until there are no moves left, whereupon the winner is the player with the most pieces.
